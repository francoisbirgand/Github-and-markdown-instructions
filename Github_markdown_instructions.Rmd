## Getting started with GitHub

I just cannot explain GitHub better than the guys who have made it, so here is a list of websites that I have chosen that explain things rather well:

* [guides.github.com](https://guides.github.com) has all the links you can dream of to get started
* [what is GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) is I think the real good starter that I recommend reading
* [workflow on Github](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) 
* I invite you to read all the other guides that they provide
* Soon you should set up your own GitHub repository after you are done with these websites

## Install *Git* on your computer

Now, after I spent quite a bit of time trying to understand the master, branches, commit, etc. I was a bit confused I must admit.  The more I read blogs, posts, etc., the more I realized that the easiest way to "add","commit", "push", and "pull", from my local directory to my repository on GitHub was not through the browser, but through the good all terminal (for mac) or cmd (for windows).

I realize that this way to navigate through the directories of your computer is not something you have been taught.  Well, in the 1990s in BAE, we had to learn Unix, so I happen to be somewhat familiar with the process.  There is really nothing to be afraid of.  Once you start a little bit, you will be glad you started this.

All this to say that I think that you should install *Git* on your computer.  [This website](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03) has the directions on how to do it.  This is what I did and it worked for me.

* [best instructions for installation for mac](https://github.com/blog/1510-installing-git-from-github-for-mac)

## Follow tutorials on the web

I think there are two complementary ways to learn how all this works:

* By watching beginners tutorials on YouTube
  - [I watched this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE) and although it is basic it makes things rather clear
  - [this one goes a little further](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVsySz-h9r4) and is quite good
  - Just type in google "GitHub beginner Youtube" and you will only have 27 million hits...!
* By trying to load real files for your work.  This is where all the things you have seen will matter

## Starting a new repository

I have made quite a few mistakes when I tried to do this so if I can help so that you do not make the same mistakes, then I have done good!  Eventually you will create a directory on your own computer where you will host all the files that you want to be tracked with GitHub.  But before you do that, go to your GitHub page (you will have signed in and created your own page above), and click on repositories at the top of your page like below.

When you do this, you should get to a page that looks just like this:

![alt text](https://github.com/francoisbirgand/Github-and-markdown-instructions/raw/master/images/GitHub_repos_page.png "Repos GitHub page")

Click on the green "New" icon and you should get to a page that looks just like this. Type the name of your repository.  You will see that GitHub automatically adds dashes for spaces in the name. In fact, in GitHub and markdown, it seems to be better to use "-" instead of "_".

![alt text](https://github.com/francoisbirgand/Github-and-markdown-instructions/raw/master/images/GitHub_newrepos_page.png "New Repos GitHub page")

The initial page will give you something that will look like this:

Now, and only now, is the time for you to create a directory where all your files will be locally stored.  Make sure that there are no files in this directory, yet.  I made that mistake several times and I spent lots of time to find the instructions to correct for this.  If you do things in this order, it should really make things smooth.

Now, it is time to feel like you know a bit about computers (I do not, as you all already know...!): time to navigate through your computer using the cmd or terminal.

* in windows, click on the Windows icon at the bottom left corner of your screen and type "cmd" in the blank text box at the bottom
* on Mac, simultaneously press the cmd-space keys, and type "terminal" in the pop-up window.
